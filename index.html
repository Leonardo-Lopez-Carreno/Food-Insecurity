    <div class="container">
    <p> Food insecurity is an issue that is particularly prevalent in New York City. Data from Feeding America shows that an average of 12.4% of the population in the city is “food insecure,” meaning that they don’t have reliable access to healthy, nutritious food.</p>

<p> Dr. Margrethe Horlyck-Romanovsky, a Health and Nutrition Sciences professor at Brooklyn College, states that food insecurity is “a buffer zone between how much people are making and what are their expenses to stay in a stable household.” </p>

<p> She also spoke on how this issue affects New York specifically, claiming that “in New York City, people have to make really difficult choices about paying for utilities, rent, health care, transportation, before they ever think about paying for food.” </p>

<p> However, Dr. Horlyck-Romanovsky also stated that food insecurity doesn’t only vary across the city, but also across each individual neighborhood. A closer look at the data shows that certain sections within each community district have a higher food insecure population. This is often influenced by factors such as the poverty rate and the racial distribution of each sector, as the data below shows. </p>
